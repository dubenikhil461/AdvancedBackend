#Latency
The Delay before Transfering the First data byte by server

#ResponseTime
Response Time = Latency + Server Processing Time + Transfer Time

#Bandwidth
Network Speed (Bandwidth)
What it measures: How much data can be sent per second.
Cause: Your ISP plan, hardware limits, server capacity.
Analogy: The number of lanes on a highway (more lanes → more cars at once).
Unit: Mbps, Gbps, etc.


#Inshort 
The sequence is:
Latency phase → Time until the first byte starts coming in (network delay).
Bandwidth phase → How fast the remaining bytes arrive once the transfer has started.
