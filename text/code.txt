| Feature           | Bytecode                                      | Machine Code                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| CPU readable?     | ❌ Needs VM to translate                      | ✅ Directly readable by CPU          |
| Portability       | ✅ Portable (run on any machine with right VM) | ❌ CPU-specific                      |
| Speed             | Slower (unless JIT compiled)                  | Fastest possible                       |
| Examples          | Java `.class`, Python `.pyc`, WebAssembly     | Native `.exe`, compiled C/C++ binaries |


| Feature                 | Source Code | Object Code | Executable (.exe) |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| **Readable by humans?** | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No        | ❌ No              |
| **Complete program?**   | ❌ No        | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes             |
| **Runs directly?**      | ❌ No        | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes             |
| **Example**             | `.c` file   | `.obj` file | `.exe` file       |


For Java (.java files)
.java → You write source code in Java.
The Java compiler (javac) translates .java → .class (bytecode).
The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) runs the .class file:
Interpreter: Reads bytecode instructions and executes them.
JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time): Translates bytecode into machine code right before execution so the CPU can run it directly.
📌 Key point — The JVM doesn’t read .java files directly; it runs .class (bytecode).

java is jit default

Java AOT Compilation (Optional)
Since Java 9, you can compile Java Ahead-Of-Time into machine code before running (using tools like jaotc or GraalVM’s native-image).
This:
Improves startup time.
Removes need for JIT at runtime.
Produces platform-specific executables (loses some portability).

summary.
Bytecode = You speak a universal language (like Esperanto) and bring an interpreter (VM) to every country.
Machine code = You speak the local language directly (super fast), but only in the country you learned it for.
