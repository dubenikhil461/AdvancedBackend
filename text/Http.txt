HTTP/1.1 – Revision Notes
🔹 Introduced (1997)

An improvement over HTTP/1.0 — still widely used.

✅ Key Features
Persistent Connections (Keep-Alive)
One TCP connection can handle multiple requests/responses.
Reduces TCP handshake overhead.
Host Header Required
Host header is mandatory → supports virtual hosting (multiple domains on one IP).
Chunked Transfer Encoding
Allows sending data in chunks without knowing total size beforehand.
Useful for streaming.
More Status Codes
Added codes like 409 Conflict, 410 Gone.
Better Caching Controls
Cache-Control, ETag, If-Modified-Since, If-None-Match.
Pipelining Support (but rarely used)
Multiple requests sent without waiting for responses (limited by HOL blocking).

⚠ Limitations
Head-of-Line Blocking in pipelining (one slow response delays all).
Still one request per connection at a time unless pipelining (no multiplexing).
Overhead in loading many small files (CSS, JS, images).

📌 Common Headers
Connection: keep-alive
Host: example.com
Cache-Control: no-cache
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
